# Some homegrown functions for dealing with .shp files
# ====================================================
# Â© Philip H. Jones, University of Liverpool, Apr 2015
#
# This home-made module contains functions to handle .shp files.
# In order to get Python to see the module, added following to .bash_profile or .bashrc:
#
# PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/phil/Dropbox/phjPythonModules; export PYTHONPATH
#
# To use the functions in this module, import phjShpFiles.
#
# Notes
# -----
# 1. phjConvertShpFileToCSV(path_and_name_of_shp_file,path_and_name_of_csv_file)
#
#    This function is used to convert a .shp file to a .csv file that can then be
# imported into a pandas dataframe. The reason that it doesn't import to a dataframe
# directly is that the process of reading in the .shp file can take a very long time. As
# a result, creating a csv file initially and then importing the csv data into a
# dataframe would probably be more efficient.
#
# To use this function:
#
# import phjShpFiles
# phjShpFiles.phjConvertShpFileToCSV('path_and_name_of_shp_file.shp','path_and_name_of_csv_file.csv')

#
# IMPORTANT NOTICE
# ================
# Since version 010beta, this script has differed from previous versions in that the
# function phjConvertShpFileToCSV() was removed and saved as a more generic function
# in phjPythonModules where it can be imported and used by other scripts.
#
# In order to accommodate this change, the following changes were made:
#
# i.   phjConvertShpFileToCSV() was moved to a file called phjShpFiles and saved in
#      phjPythonModules.
# 
# ii.  phjConvertShpFileToCSV() originally defined the path and the name of the shp file
#      within the function. However, in the new version, the path and name of the shp
#      file is passed as a parameter, i.e.
#         phjConvertShpFileToCSV('path_and_name_of_shp_file.shp','path_and_name_of_csv_file.csv')
# 
# iii. As a consequence of ii above, the variable phjPathAndShpFilename is defined at
#      the top of the file.
#
# iv.  The new version of the function imports necessary libraries.
# 
# v.   In order to use the function, the function is imported using:
#         import phjShpFiles
#
# vi.  The function is called as:
#         phjShpFiles.phjConvertShpFileToCVS('path_and_name_of_shp_file.shp','path_and_name_of_csv_file.csv')

		# ===========================
		# The output from fiona is a Python ordered dict collection. Shapefiles have the

		# 
		# Structure of polygon geometry type
		# ----------------------------------
		# The coordinates section (see below) is a list of lists defining the exterior polygon
		# polygon (LinearRing) and any internal polygons ("holes") within the external polygon
		# (e.g. may represent a lake). Each off-shore island is a different feature.
		# The following shows how each feature is represented:
		#                                                               ONE AND ONLY POLYGON
