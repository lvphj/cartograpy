# CartograPy

A personal foray into the world of GIS using Python.

The functions included in this repository are not intended to be used in the real world. They are primarily intended for my own amusement, as a way of exploring some of the potential for GIS appkications. For example, the phjPointInPolygon() function identifies the polygons in a shp file that contain a list of points, effectively performing a spatial join. Undoubtedly, this task can be achieved much easier and much, much quicker using something like GeoPandas. However, sometimes it's fun to write your own function to perform an algorithm, just to see if it works!
